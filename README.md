# 🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation and Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation based on spending behavior using machine learning techniques. The workflow includes:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Customer segmentation using clustering methods
- Classification model training and evaluation
- Insights generation for business applications

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of mall customers’ demographic and spending information.

### Features:
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Genre**: Gender of the customer (Male/Female)
- **Age**: Age of the customer
- **Annual Income (k$)**: Customer’s annual income in thousand dollars
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: Score assigned based on spending habits

## 🔬 Data Exploration & Preprocessing
- Checking for missing values and handling inconsistencies
- Visualizing customer demographics and spending trends
- Scaling and encoding categorical variables if needed

## 🤖 Customer Segmentation
### K-Means Clustering
- Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers based on `Annual Income` and `Spending Score`
- Used the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters
- Visualized customer groups using scatter plots

## 🤖 Model Training
Several machine learning models are used to classify customer segments:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Hyperparameter tuning is performed to improve accuracy and model performance.

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Identified distinct customer segments based on spending behavior
- Compared classification models for customer prediction
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualized feature importance and cluster distribution

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Implement additional clustering methods like DBSCAN
- Use deep learning models for better classification accuracy
- Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or FastAPI
